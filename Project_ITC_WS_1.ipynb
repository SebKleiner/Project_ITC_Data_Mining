Shortly after, they were caught up in the renewed interest in religion that was the Second Great Awakening.</p>\\n\\n<p>Joseph Smith was worried about his soul, and so wanted to be sure he joined the right church, but wasn&#39;t able to decide.  Finally, he came across James 1:5, &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p>We believe that in 1820, Joseph Smith at 14 years old, went to a grove of trees behind their farm to pray and ask God which church to join.  We believe that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him and was told to join none of them.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the process of time, we believe that Joseph Smith was chosen to be a modern-day prophet, someone who receives revelation from Jesus Christ, and who has received from Him the authority to lead Christ&#39;s church.</p>\\n\\n<h1>Book of Mormon</h1>\\n\\n<p>We believe that in 1823, an angel appeared to Joseph Smith who told him that there was a book written on metal plates buried in a nearby hill.  We believe that in time, Joseph was able to receive the plates, and then translate them by the gift and power of God.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Book of Mormon takes place at the same time as the Bible, but tells God&#39;s dealings with a group of people in the Americas.  These people left Jerusalem prior to its destruction by Babylon.</p>\\n\\n<p>They taught of Jesus Christ, and the highlight of the book is when Jesus Christ visits these people some time after His resurrection.  However, they eventually fell into wickedness and destruction.  The book also includes a brief history of another group of people who left for the Americas at the time of the Tower of Babel, who also eventually fell into wickedness and destruction.</p>\\n\\n<h1>Other Beliefs</h1>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>We believe Heavenly Father is literally the Father of our Spirits.</li>\\n<li>We believe that Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins so that we may be forgiven.</li>\\n<li>We believe that Jesus Christ rose again the third day so that we will also rise again.</li>\\n<li>We believe that Jesus Christ created His church and gave Apostles authority to act in His name.</li>\\n<li>We believe through this authority of Jesus Christ, families can be together forever.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng\">Some other beliefs</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h1>Meet the Panelists</h1>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/WooperSlim\">/u/WooperSlim</a></strong> -- I grew up in the church in Utah.  I&#39;m a single 32-year-old Software Engineer.  I enjoy board games, biking, hiking, and camping.  I&#39;m a fan of Doctor Who, and my favorite movie is Back to the Future.  I&#39;ve served in the Church as a missionary in Virginia, I&#39;ve been a Sunday School teacher, a Ward Mission Leader, and Assistant Ward Clerk.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/SHolmesSkittle\">/u/SHolmesSkittle</a></strong> -- I was born and raised in Utah and in the Church. I&#39;m a single white female attending a congregation of 18- to 30-year-old Young Single Adults in my area. In my congregation, I currently serve as the Extra Activities Committee Chair for the Relief Society. Essentially I plan an activity every couple of months for the sisters in the congregation. I served a mission in the Florida Jacksonville Mission for 18 months and returned from that about nine months ago. I currently work for the LDS Church News as an editorial assistant. While it&#39;s a part of the Utah-based Deseret News, it&#39;s an official publication of the Church with a national reach. I enjoy Zumba, knitting, writing, Batman, mysteries, superhero action movies, cross-stitching, Sherlock Holmes, traveling and blogging.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/testudoaubreii\">/u/testudoaubreii</a></strong> -- adult convert, 30+ years in the church. Married in the temple, serving in a stake leadership calling. Haven&#39;t been a bishop but have had just about every other ward-level calling. I have six kids and a bunch of grandkids, and have a very happy marriage and family life (not perfect, but very happy).</p>\\n\\n<p>I&#39;m involved in scientific research and education. I&#39;d say I&#39;m both a mainstream Latter-day Saint and a mainstream scientist, working in cognitive science (and with models of consciousness, which is always interesting!). I have a testimony of Jesus Christ and of the Restoration, and I have no problem with the universe being 13.8 billion years old or with evolution as the process by which life emerged on earth. Politically I&#39;m a centrist Democrat.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/The_Town_\">/u/The_Town_</a></strong> -- [waiting on reply]</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/Temujin_123\">/u/Temujin_123</a></strong> -- I am a life-long Mormon in the United States. I grew up and have lived outside Utah except for the 4 years I went to BYU in Provo. I served a mission in South Korea and have served in church congregations in capacities such as teaching and clerical work. Religiously, I am a currently practicing member of the LDS church and identify as a post-secular Mormon with transhuman and apeirotheism world-views. I enjoy studying religion and philosophy, love discovering the truths they contain, and bring those back to shape the contours of my Mormonism.</p>\\n\\n<p>I have a degree in computer science and work at a Fortune 100 company. In my past time I support my wife in her running her own business, do my best to create math and science fans of my kids, and dust off my piano playing skills (my favorite piece of music to play is Debussy&#39;s &#39;Clair de Lune&#39;).</p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/Quiott\">/u/Quiott</a></strong> -- I went to BYU and like Seinfeld. I was born into a family who goes to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gone on a mission. I actually don&#39;t have much time to answer in this AMA and will chime in when I review an answer and think I have more to share. I have debated Christianities truth at length online - If I do feel like I can answer your questions I will likely try to stick to official doctrine - </p>\\n\\n<p><strong><a href=\"/u/keylimesoda\">/u/keylimesoda</a></strong> -- Grew up in NY, Portland, Utah, Idaho and Texas. Missionary in Tennessee, escaped from BYU, served in various callings, currently teaching 4 year old Sunday school (sunbeams) with my wife.</p>\\n\\n<p>Software guy at Microsoft. Studied Computer Science, with some dabblings in philosophy and music. Love singing, football, electronic music (trip-hop, EDM, post dub), coffee shops (best hot chocolate), video games, small animals and wrestling with my 3 little kids.</p>\\n\\n<p>I&#39;d consider myself a TBM, though I&#39;m told I&#39;m not a &quot;normal&quot; Mormon by friends. I think I&#39;m okay with that.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"search-expando-button collapsed\"><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-collapsed\">more</span><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-expanded\">less</span></div></div></div><div class=\" search-result search-result-link has-thumbnail has-linkflair linkflair-science \" data-fullname=\"t3_2ftwt1\"><a href=\"/r/IAmA/comments/2ftwt1/iama_scientist_who_wrote_the_study_finding_97/\" class=\"may-blank thumbnail self\"></a><div><header class=\"search-result-header\"><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ftwt1/iama_scientist_who_wrote_the_study_finding_97/\" class=\"search-title may-blank\" >IamA scientist who wrote the study finding 97% consensus on human-caused global warming.

In 2007, I created <a href=\"http://skepticalscience.com/\">Skeptical Science,</a> a website debunking climate misinformation with peer-reviewed science. The website won the 2011 Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was lead-author of the paper <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article\">Quantifying the Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming in the Scientific Literature,</a> published in 2013 in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The paper was tweeted by President Obama, is the most downloaded paper in the 80 journals published by the Institute of Physics and was awarded the best paper in Environmental Research Letters in 2013.</p>\\n\\n<p>I co-authored the online booklet The Debunking Handbook, a popular booklet translated into 7 languages that offers a practical guide to effectively refuting misinformation. I also co-authored the book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand and the college textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis.</p>\\n\\n<p>I&#39;m currently in England finishing my PhD in cognitive psychology, researching the psychology of climate change and how to neutralise the influence of misinformation.

I am a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol, and I was a Winthrop Professor at the University of Western Australia for nearly 20 years before I moved to the UK a year ago in search of adventure and worse weather. I am also affiliated with the Cabot Institute at the University of Bristol. I have been fascinated by three big issues for the last 30 years as a researcher and scholar: How the human mind works, how people organize themselves into societies, and how the way we live fits within the constraints of our planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>I received my undergraduate degree from Washington College (Chestertown, MD), and a Masters and PhD from the University of Toronto. I served on the Faculty at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1995 before moving to Australia in search of adventures and great weather.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve published around 150 peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters, and books. Most of them deal with basic memory processes and mathematical models of the mind, but for the last few years I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become increasingly interested in climate change and how people deal with the risks posed from climate change. I discovered that climate change research, sadly, is confronted with the dissemination of a substantial amount of disinformation. I have applied my research to this issue, and a small handbook that summarizes the literature on how to debunk misinformation can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html</a> . The Debunking Handbook was written by John Cook and myself and has now been translated into virtually all languages short of Swahili. </p>\\n\\n<p>My most recent papers have dealt with the implications of uncertainty about our knowledge in the climate system. In a nutshell, the greater the uncertainty the more we have to worry about the future\\xe2\\x80\\x94so uncertainty should be an impetus for action rather than an excuse for delay. Some summaries of that work (by others) can be found here <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncertainty-isnt-cause-for-climate-complacency-quite-the-opposite-25481\">https://theconversation.com/uncertainty-isnt-cause-for-climate-complacency-quite-the-opposite-25481</a> and here <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/04/climate-change-uncertainty-stronger-tackling-case\">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/04/climate-change-uncertainty-stronger-tackling-case</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>I have also recently published 3 papers that show that denial of climate science is often associated with an element of conspiratorial thinking or discourse. Further confirmation for my research can be found in the work of Senator Inhofe, who recently published a book entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Greatest Hoax: How the global warming conspiracy threatens your future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n<p>I look forward to answering your question about psychology, cognition, uncertainty in climate science, and the politics surrounding all that today 8am EDT, 1 PM GMT. Ask me almost anything!</p>\\n\\n<p>Moderator Note:</p>\\n\\n<p>The time difference between most of Reddit&#39;s users and Western Australia makes this AMA challenging, Dr. Lewandowsky will be answering questions in the morning, but will return the next day to answer those that were posted later in the day during sleeping hours in his time zone.  Please be patient, managing time zones this far apart is a challenge.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also due to the nature of this research, please be on your best behavior as comment rules will be strictly enforced.  If you are unable to behave in a civil manner please do not post a comment.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Folks, thank you so much for tuning in. It&#39;s now after 10pm here in Perth and I will have to take a break for the night. I hope to resume answering questions for another hour tomorrow morning, about 9 to 10 hours from now.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Thanks again for tuning in, I&#39;ve now spent another hour on responding to many interesting comments during my morning in Perth. I am sorry I couldn&#39;t answer all comments but I had a great time answering your questions. Please note that I provided citations to lots of papers while answering questions, so you may want to search this thread for references -- your question may well have been answered with a pointer to the literature.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I neglected to mention that my blog, <a href=\"http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org\">www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org</a>, will continue to publish posts relevant to the issues discussed here.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot that understanding aging can teach us about our pets\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 did you know that large breed dogs age faster than small breed dogs, and that aging pets may experience more sleepless nights? Did you know dogs and cats are considered senior around age 7 and begin to experience physical and cognitive changes? Aging is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases not only in pets, but humans as well, so by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, humans and pets can expect to live healthier, longer lives.</p>\\n\\n<p>My research is aimed at better understanding \\xe2\\x80\\x98healthspan,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the period of life spent in good health free of disease and disability, so we can maximize the healthy years of our pets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives. I study aging in dogs not only because they are man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best friend, but because they age very similarly to us, share similar genetic and phenotypic diversity and, most uniquely, share our daily environment. Imagine the strides we can make with advancing human healthspan if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able to fully understand how to increase the healthspan of our pets!</p>\\n\\n<p>A bit <a href=\"http://kaeberleinlab.org/people/matt-kaeberlein\">more about me</a>: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the Co-Director of the <a href=\"http://dogagingproject.com/trial-one-study/\">Dog Aging Project</a>, Adjunct Professor of Genome Sciences and Oral Health Sciences and a Professor of Pathology at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Fries are cheap; just ask for fresh ones because we don&#39;t care.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you&#39;re in the drive-through, please interrupt our stupid Welcoming with your order - we really do not mind, in fact, we like it.</p></li>\\n<li><p>The busier a food place is, the better your food will be; be patient.  The food is fresher when the store is busy because we have to keep making more food due to the volume of people.  It&#39;s really that simple.</p></li>\\n<li><p>At some food chains where you would tip before getting your food, the tip will guarantee the best food.  Even 50 cents is a generous tip in some places.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you go to a coffee place regularly and you notice regular employee&#39;s, introduce yourself by name.  It makes it a lot easier to remember your orders (eg. &quot;Ryan gets 1 sugar 1 cream&quot; or &quot;Ryan is a regular guy and Greg likes it black&quot; the jokes are endless, I know)</p></li>\\n<li><p>Calling ahead of time with your order is ALWAYS a good idea.  It makes it a lot easier for us to make your food top quality and ready for you to pick up.  This applies to basically every type of food place, from fast to formal.  Just.. make sure you&#39;re there the time you say and don&#39;t bitch if you come late and it&#39;s cold.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Fast food chains hate multi-ordering through the drive-through only really because most places use a time limit to serve people.  If you have the time, let them know you intend to drive around again and it will really help out their time and serving you.  I have personally given free food to people for doing this but it is understandable when you cannot (ie. in a taxi).</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>From working in Photo Labs;</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>We see every photo you take and it will be stored on the photo lab computers for months.  Keep this in mind when you bring the pictures there, or lose them.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Most photo labs cannot print &quot;scandalous&quot; pictures.  However, some people (like myself) will break this rule since we are the only ones seeing it anyway.  Use your judgment about the person you hand the photo&#39;s in to, and acknowledging it right away might give a better indication to printing availability.</p></li>\\n<li><p>The self-print machines almost always still require an employee to &quot;ok&quot; the print.  However, if you screw up the picture and let the employee know, you might get away with a free print.  Sometimes, you&#39;ll get an asshole who will cut up the picture though.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Although they are becoming rare, &quot;one-hour&quot; photo development doesn&#39;t really take an hour.  It&#39;s just an estimate if we are busy.  It generally only takes 5-10 minutes. </p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>From working as a myster shopper;</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>If you ever have to make a move, look for this job.  Tell them you will travel to any cities in moving destination and they will pay for your gas.  In addition, you might be as lucky as me and do mystery shopping so that you are paid to move and drink beer.  </p></li>\\n<li><p>Since mystery shoppers get compensated only a certain small amount, we are inclined to buy the most cheap thing.  This is really the only clue I could give to identifying a mystery shopper but I can tell you that most mystery shopping criticism is entirely based on the person serving us.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>From working as a Telemarketer/Customer Service Rep.;</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>If you don&#39;t want to hear us and you are in a rush, just say &quot;NO&#39; and hang up.  It is NOT polite to wait for us to stop or to try and discuss with us why you are not interested.  Telemarketers MUST keep talking and rarely have the permission to hang up.  Also, you must say &quot;no&quot; and not just hang up and hanging up can be labelled as a call back since you did not explicitly state no interest.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you have the time, ask for the telemarketer&#39;s name and company name they are working for along with any possible contact numbers.  If simply ask to be put on a &quot;Do not call&quot; list, it will only be for the product they are selling.  If you ask to be put on the do not call list for the company, then it&#39;s for all the products they sell.  Also, if they call you back, you are on legal grounds to sue for at least $500 up to $5k (Not sure on the current actual amount now)</p></li>\\n<li><p>In the mood to fuck with someone?  Any telemarketer will tell you that they don&#39;t mind if you make idle conversation with them or just sit the phone down.  I once had a shift where the client told me they will &quot;brb&quot; and put the phone down.  I literally drifted through a 6 hour shift on this guys phone because I guess he though he was &quot;pwning&quot; me but I loved that I got paid to just sit there and chill reading a book while &quot;on hold&quot; with a customer.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you ever have to call in for tech support, the rep. is likely using a tutorial program that they have to use in a series of steps.  We really don&#39;t mind you interrupting and answering them right away or letting us know the basics you did, but if it turns out the solution is one of those basic questions (ie. plug it in).. you&#39;re a fucking idiot.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Telemarketers have heard all the jokes you have about fucking with telemarketers.  Yes, we&#39;ve seen Seinfeld.  It&#39;s not funny.  In fact, many places use the recording devices to record peoples outbursts or insults and listen to them after work or on break.  It&#39;s the same device used for recording sales &quot;for quality purposes&quot; but since we get more outbursts than sales, it&#39;s much more fun to use for recording people freaking out on us.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>From working as a Psychologist/General Life Protips;</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>There is a key time for people that gives a good indication of their commitment to changes and adpatation; three months.  If a relationship can last over 3 months, it has a good chance of lasting much longer.  If you start a long-distance relationship, the 3 month mark is usually when things start to stress.  If someone is let out of therapy or jail, they usually return within 3 months (or commit suicide).  There is a good reason why employment probation is typically 3 months.  Keep this in mind with all life commitments and plan accordingly.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If a man makes any misogynistic &quot;jokes&quot;, leave him.  </p></li>\\n<li><p>The basics are this; men seek reproductivity appeal.  The more likely a woman can reproduce a child (young and healthy), the more attractive they are.  Women seek security and support.  The more likely a man can protect and support a family (age/maturity and finances/strength), the more attractive they are.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you think you are manipulating someone by learning everything they like and you try be that person.. you have it dead backwards.  You are the one being manipulated.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Focusing on negative goals actually encourages them.  For example, focusing on a goal to &quot;not smoke&quot; or to &quot;not be/do/take/be like X&quot; actually maintains a conscious frame around that topic.  Instead, make it a goal to be what you want to be, not the negative of something.  Instead of &quot;not smoke anymore&quot;, focus on &quot;being healthy&quot;; it broadens your horizons and takes the stress away from trying to avoid that negative goal.</p></li>\\n<li><p>&quot;Cathartic release&quot; is bullshit.  It is NOT a good idea to vent and it is especially not a good idea to let a friend or special interest &quot;take it out on you&quot;.  This actually conditions the person to thinking that they cannot feel stress-free until they do something about it such as complain or be violent.  Cathartic therapy hasn&#39;t been in use for years for a good reason and yet the public still embraces it.  Stop it.</p></li>\\n<li><p>There is a fundamental rule for relationships to know if they are crashing and burning, it is called the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;:</p></li>\\n<li><p>Criticism: Small snide and likely pedantic remarks which may seem to the author as obvious truths, but will be received as incredibly insulting and disrespectful.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Contempt; General insulting behaviour, especially during conflicts. This is exemplary in explicit personal attacks.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Defensiveness: Usually a response to criticism.  This is when the one is assuming the other is making personal attacks and needs justification or explanation.  Can also be the assumption that the other is blaming them for their stress or complaints.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Stonewalling: Essentially the &quot;silent-treatment&quot;.  This is when the one completely removes themself from the other whether it be the room, house, turning off the phone, etc.</p></li>\\n<li><p>As a foot note to the above, a relationship is best identified by how they handle conflict:</p></li>\\n<li><p>Those who claim to never fight are likely harbouring a lot of feelings, there is not a lot of intimacy, or lacking sincereity.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Those who claim to fight too much, but don&#39;t have symptoms of the Four Horsemen are likely the victims of environmental stressors and should NOT be blaming each other or considering divorce.  Far too often people break off when they shouldn&#39;t just because they feel obligated to.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Those who can have an argument and resolve them within a day are generally the healthiest you can be.  Learning to admit you are wrong and say sorry is much more admirable than admitting you are right.</p></li>\\n<li><p>The 10% of your brain meme is nothing but gibberish.  Without even providing any science, just imagine you and I decide to go on a road trip.  We don&#39;t know where we are going, we just decide to go on a road trip.  You then ask me, &quot;how far along are we?&quot; and I say, &quot;we&#39;re 10% of the way there&quot;.  That makes as much sense as the 10% myth because the premise of the myth is that we do not know our brains boundries, though we apparently know we only use 10% of it.  Please kill this myth..</p></li>\\n<li><p>Right/Left Brain Psychology is bullshit.  Every single brain function is facilitated by multiple parts of both hemispheres. Certainly there are more dense areas of acitivity on some parts, but this is best thought of as like a symphony; there is an interaction and dependence of each individual playing part for each individual act.  Anything that says otherwise is simply trying to get money out of you, plain and simple.</p></li>\\n<li><p>If you ever consider therapy, always ask to meet the Dr. first.  This ought to be free and if it isn&#39;t, do not consider them. If you have a physical condition causing you stress, seek Neurologists.  If you have behavioural problems (ie. alcohol, substance), seek cognitive behavioural therapy.  For anything else, seek humanistic.  Never consider Gestalt.  Psychodynamic therapy is too expensive and mostly bullshit.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Getting someone to like you, from a psychological standpoint:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Proximity effect; people tend to like those that they are in simple proximity of. If you have not met yet, just try to make an appearance, and nothing more. Keep this up for a few weeks and then, when it seems right, introduce yourself. If you do know them, try to keep a consistent brief meetings firstly. This builds interest.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Touch. A simple handshake, tap on the shoulder, hug, etc. releases oxytocin which will be conditioned as a response to you. Don&#39;t overdo it though as it will become an overkill, and don&#39;t avoid it either because it will create obvious distance.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Every time she smiles or laughs, do a subtle action such as wiggling your fingers, something that isn&#39;t too obvious. The goal is to associate her positive attitude with your actions so that you can do this action (wiggling hands) to encourage the smiling/positive mood.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Please share your own insights.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"search-expando-button collapsed\"><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-collapsed\">more</span><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-expanded\">less</span></div></div></div><div class=\" search-result search-result-link has-thumbnail has-linkflair linkflair-psych linkflair-AMA \" data-fullname=\"t3_2or00m\"><a href=\"/r/science/comments/2or00m/science_ama_series_we_are_a_group_of_researchers/\" class=\"may-blank thumbnail self\"></a><div><header class=\"search-result-header\"><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2or00m/science_ama_series_we_are_a_group_of_researchers/\" class=\"search-title may-blank\" >Science AMA Series: We are a Group of Researchers Exploring Auditory Hallucinations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 People Who Hear Voices.

Usually associated with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia, voice-hearing is also an important aspect of many ordinary people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives. Our project seeks to examine this phenomenon from as many different relevant perspectives as possible. In addition to exploring subjective experiences of voice-hearing, we are investigating their underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms, and the ways in which hearing voices has been interpreted and represented in different cultural, historical and religious contexts. </p>\\n\\n<p>You can find out more about voice hearing and our work in a podcast documentary published this week on Mosaic science: <a href=\"http://mosaicscience.com\">http://mosaicscience.com</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Here is a brief description of each of us:</p>\\n\\n<p>Dr Charles Fernyhough (<a href=\"/u/Prof_Fernyhough\">/u/Prof_Fernyhough</a>) is Professor of Psychology at Durham University and the Director of Hearing the Voice.

The focus of his recent scientific work has been in applying ideas from mainstream developmental psychology to the study of psychosis, particularly the phenomenon of voice-hearing (in which individuals hear voices in the absence of any speaker).He has developed a new model of voice-hearing and inner speech, and conducted empirical studies testing aspects of the model in clinical and healthy samples. He is a core group member of Hubbub, an interdisciplinary project exploring rest and busyness, and the first occupants of the Hub at Wellcome Collection.

This tradition has a storied history of pushing for psychology to be a science. When I apply for funding, I do so through the <em>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</em> \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not through health or social sciences agencies. On the other hand, I also take the principles of behaviourism to study &#39;unobservable&#39; cognitive phenomena in animals, including time perception and metacognition.</p>\\n\\n<p>So\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 is psychology a science? Science is broadly defined as <em>the study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments or controlled observation</em>. It depends on empirical evidence (observed data, not beliefs), control (that cause and effect can only be determined by minimizing extraneous variables), objective definitions (specific and quantifiable terms) and predictability (that data should be reproduced in similar situations in the future). Does psychological research fit these parameters?</p>\\n\\n<p>There have been strong questions as to whether psychology can produce <a href=\"http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/07/keep-psychology-out-of-science-club.html\">objective definitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/first-results-from-psychology-s-largest-reproducibility-test-1.17433\">reproducible conclusions</a>, and whether the predominant statistical tests used in psychology <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.5950&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">properly test their claims</a>. Of course, these are questions facing many modern scientific fields (think of evolution or string theory). So <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/is-psychology-a-e2809creale2809d-science-does-it-really-matter/\">rather than asking whether psychology should be considered a science</a>, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably more constructive to ask what psychology still has to learn from the \\xe2\\x80\\x98hard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sciences, <em>and vice versa</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>A few related sub-questions that are worth considering as part of this:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>1.    Is psychology a unitary discipline?</strong> The first thing that many freshman undergraduates (hopefully) learn is that there is much more to psychology than Freud. These can range from heavily \\xe2\\x80\\x98applied\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disciplines such as clinical, community, or industrial/organizational psychology, to basic science areas like personality psychology or cognitive neuroscience. The ostensible link between all of these is that psychology is the <em>study of behaviour</em>, even though in many cases the behaviour ends up being used to infer unseeable mechanisms proposed to underlie behaviour. Different areas of psychology will gravitate toward different methods (from direct measures of overt behaviours to indirect measures of covert behaviours like Likert scales or EEG) and scientific philosophies. The field is also littered with former philosophers, computer scientists, biologists, sociologists, etc. Different scholars, even in the same area, will often have very different approaches to answering psychological questions.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>2.    Does psychology provide information of value to other sciences?</strong> The functional question, really. Does psychology provide something of value? One of my big pet peeves as a student of animal behaviour is to look at papers in neuroscience, ecology, or medicine that have wonderful biological methods but shabby behavioural measures. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t infer anything about the brain, an organism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s function in its environment, or a drug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effects if you are correlating it with behaviour and using an incorrect behavioural task. These are the sorts of scientific questions where researchers should be collaborating with psychologists. Psychological theories like reinforcement learning can directly inform fields like computing science (machine learning), and form whole subdomains like biopsychology and psychophysics. Likewise, social sciences have produced results that are important for <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/opinion/la-oe-wilson-social-sciences-20120712\">directing money and effort for social programs</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>3.    Is \\xe2\\x80\\x98common sense\\xe2\\x80\\x99 science of value?</strong> Psychology in the media faces an issue that is less common in chemistry or physics; the public can generate their own assumptions and anecdotes about expected answers to many psychology questions. There are well-understood issues with believing something \\xe2\\x80\\x98obvious\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on face value, however. First, common sense can generate multiple answers to a question, and post-hoc reasoning simply makes the discovered answer the obvious one (referred to as <em>hindsight bias</em>). Second, \\xe2\\x80\\x98common sense\\xe2\\x80\\x99 does not necessarily mean \\xe2\\x80\\x98correct\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and it is always worth answering a question even if only to verify the common sense reasoning.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4.    Can human scientists ever be objective about the human experience?</strong> This is a very difficult problem because of how subjective our general experience within the world can be. Being human influences the questions we ask, the way we collect data, and the way we interpret results. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likewise a problem in my field, where it is difficult to balance <em>anthropocentrism</em> (believing that humans have special significance as a species) and <em>anthropomorphism</em> (attributing human qualities to animals). A rat is neither a tiny human nor a \\xe2\\x80\\x98sub-human\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which makes it very difficult for a human to objectively answer a question like <em>Does a rat have episodic memory, and how would we know if it did?</em></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>5.    Does a field have to be &#39;scientific&#39; to be valid?</strong> <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vUcXBAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=humanistic+psychology&amp;ots=i76eAYHL0P&amp;sig=KyfDCJ4LzqSEAOFqcgS83Lgr3Po#v=onepage&amp;q=humanistic%20psychology&amp;f=false\">Some psychologists</a> have pushed back against the century-old movement to make psychology more rigorously scientific by trying to return the field to its philosophical, humanistic roots. Examples include using qualitative, introspective processes to look at how individuals experience the world. After all, astrology is arguably <em>more scientific</em> than history, but few would claim it is <em>more true</em>. Is it necessary for psychology to be considered a science for it to produce important conclusions about behaviour?</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, in a lighthearted attempt to demonstrate the difficulty in \\xe2\\x80\\x98ranking\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the \\xe2\\x80\\x98hardness\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98usefulness\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of scientific disciplines, I turn you to two relevant XKCDs: <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/1520/\">http://xkcd.com/1520/</a> <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/435/\">https://xkcd.com/435/</a></p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"search-expando-button collapsed\"><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-collapsed\">more</span><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-expanded\">less</span></div></div></div><div class=\" search-result search-result-link has-thumbnail no-linkflair \" data-fullname=\"t3_6qbw5f\"><a href=\"/r/IAmA/comments/6qbw5f/we_are_phd_students_from_harvard_university_here/\" class=\"may-blank thumbnail self\"></a><div><header class=\"search-result-header\"><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6qbw5f/we_are_phd_students_from_harvard_university_here/\" class=\"search-title may-blank\" >We are PhD students from Harvard University here to answer questions about artificial intelligence and cognition.

We are working to develop new and better treatments to help improve the lives of individuals suffering with these disorders.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re excited to hear all of your questions about OCD and related disorders. We hope that we can demystify any preconceptions or confusion that you have about it.\\nWe will be answering questions about, but not limited to: current research we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, our own experiences working here at the clinic, treatment options for those suffering with OCD, and our experiences navigating the field of academia.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can visit our website for more information: <a href=\"http://columbiapsychiatry.org/ocd\">http://columbiapsychiatry.org/ocd</a> \\nLike our Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OCDCenter\">https://www.facebook.com/OCDCenter</a>\\nand Follow our Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/columbiaocd\">https://twitter.com/columbiaocd</a></p>\\n\\n<p>We would love to read all your questions and thoughts you have about OCD and related disorders!\\nAsk us anything on Monday, July 20th, at 2:30PM (11:30AM PST)</p>\\n\\n<p>Our team includes:\\nHelen Blair Simpson (HBS) M.D., Ph.D, Director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic and the OCD Research Program at NYSPI (New York State Psychiatric Institute) \\nFor as long as I remember, I have been interested in what causes our behavior. I also like to help people. Thus, after graduating from Yale College, I pursued my MD-PhD at the Rockefeller University/Cornell University Medical College where I studied the brain pathways underlying animal behavior. I then completed my internship and residency in psychiatry at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, so that I could help people with mental illness whose behavior has gone awry. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working here at Columbia since 1996 (almost 20 years!!), but I am still learning new things every day. Now Director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic and the Center of OCD and Related Disorders, I study what causes OCD and I develop new treatments for it. I like most helping my patients transform their lives for the better. </p>\\n\\n<p>Raphael Campeas (RC) M.D., Research Psychiatrist in the ADC at NYSPI and Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a New Yorker for quite some time, as I graduated from Mount Sinai Medical School in 1979 and completed my internship in the Adult Internal medicine at Brookdale Hospital in NYC. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working at the Anxiety Disorders Clinic since then, where I have experience with OCD, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, GAD, PTSD, and Heightened Illness Concern.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to all the questions you guys have to offer. </p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew B.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a therapist and researcher at the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. My research interests are related to understanding the different ways people think when they are anxious. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m particularly interested in assessing and manipulating cognitive biases. I study these biases to gain insight into onset, maintenance, neurobiology, and treatment of anxiety disorders and OCD.\\nI received my Ph.D in clinical psychology from the University of Virginia, and I have extensive training in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) for anxiety disorders and OCD. Other interests include reading, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Michael Wheaton (MW), Ph.D Adjunct Associate Clinical Researcher in the ADC; Assistant Professor, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University\\nI completed my undergraduate studies at Cornell University, and went on to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to receive my Ph.D in clinical psychology.

Understanding how the body works, or doesn&#39;t&#39; work in the case of disease, has progressed leaps and bounds in the last 200 years. Yet the brain has remained a mystery. The field of Neuroscience is a young one but has grown to include hundreds of thousands of researchers all over the world. I have always been fascinated by Human behaviour and my research revolves around understanding some of the fundamental workings of the brain, such as memory and cognition. Importantly, discoveries in Neuroscience are revolutionizing disparate areas of Society that range from treating Mental Illness to economics and how people make decisions. </p>\\n\\n<p>The advent of the internet and social media has meant that access to knowledge is easier than ever, but misinformation is also rife. Scientists need to interact with the public in a forum that allows their work to be understood and be accessible. I think the Reddit AMAs are a great way of both show casing the exciting research going on as well as highlighting the fact that scientists are also ordinary citizens. I have tattoos, enjoy playing rugby and hiking the beautiful mountains of Utah...for example! </p>\\n\\n<p>I will try to answer questions on the brain, dispel myths and highlight new and exciting things going on in Brain research. However, I stress that I&#39;m not a medical doctor and as such am not an expert on the best treatments for neurological disorders. I am, however, happy to discuss what new research is currently telling us about the biology/causes of disorders such as Autism, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease and other cognitive disorders. </p>\\n\\n<p>The views expressed in this AMA are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the University of Utah.</p>\\n\\n<p>I will start answering questions at <strong>12 noon EST</strong>, AMAA!</p>\\n\\n<p>Group Website:  <a href=\"http://www.shepherdlab.org/\">http://www.shepherdlab.org/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Edit:  Prof. Shepherd has a meeting from 3:30 EST to 5:00 EST (1:30-3 pm MT) and will be away during this time, he will return to answer more question later today!</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit 2: </p>\\n\\n<p>From Prof. Shepherd: Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread and asked questions...it was gratifying to see so much interest! I apologize if I did not get to your specific question, was totally overwhelmed by the response! I encourage people to look through the thread though as many asked the same questions and I did manage to answer what I thought were the most popular ones. I would also like to thank the moderators on here for organizing this.

I fly a private jet with a colleague of mine. We&#39;re good friends and we get along quite well. I&#39;ve always known that he&#39;s very religious, and he knows that I&#39;m an atheist. Over the time we&#39;ve worked together we&#39;ve had a number of discussions about religion and it&#39;s always been respectful. </p>\\n\\n<p>Although he&#39;s very stringent in his beliefs (as am I) he&#39;s very respectful of my beliefs and thankfully he doesn&#39;t try to preach to me. Every time we have a discussion about religion though, I learn a little more about his beliefs. And...wow. He&#39;s out there. This is the thing that gets me though. He is literally the smartest person I&#39;ve ever met. We have some seriously heavy discussions about science, physics, quantum mechanics, etc, and his level of knowledge is astounding to me. Yet....he believes the Earth is 6000 years old. I&#39;ve heard of cognitive dissonance but...holy fuck. Last night I asked him how to reconciles his YEC beliefs with the incredible amount of evidence against those beliefs and he gave me a long explanation which essentially boiled down to &quot;the amount of knowledge we have about the Universe, versus how much there is to know, is so small that we really can&#39;t be sure of anything&quot;. Jesus fuck. </p>\\n\\n<p>Thankfully, he&#39;s still a pretty reasonable guy, and he understands that there&#39;s a mountain of evidence against his beliefs, and he freely admits that he might be wrong and this is just what he believes. </p>\\n\\n<p>I guess the reason for this post is I just wanted to express how amazing it is to me that religious indoctrination can take someone like him, someone who is incredibly intelligent, and make them believe the Earth is 6000 years old. My mind is blown. When I saw he&#39;s the smartest guy I&#39;ve ever met I mean it. As long as the discussion is about anything but religion or god, he&#39;s extremely intelligent.</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit: Wow this blew up much more than I was expecting. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read my post and to comment.

Here are my Top 8:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>1) Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Sapiens is, without exaggeration, one of the most perspective changing books I&#39;ve read. He presents a history of mankind, but in a deeper way than simply talking about the agricultural revolution. His concept of the &quot;Cognitive Revolution&quot;, in which humans used shared myths such as the concept of nationhood, money, religion, capitalism and so on to form extremely large and powerful societies, is fascinating, and well worth exploring.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>2) Why I No Longer Talk To White People About Race - Reni Eddo-Lodge</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Far from the controversial title, this book is actually about talking to white people about race. But it goes further than that: it&#39;s about how white people <strong>should</strong> be talking about race, and so should we all - not talking about racism won&#39;t make it go away. Eddo-Lodge is from the UK, and presents a really insightful account of black British history. As a white man, this was another book that helped explain so many things I had only vaguely understood before, and was another hugely perspective-changing book.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>3) Dataclysm - Christian Rudder</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>On the surface, this is a book about how we can use data to understand people. Written by one of the founders of OkCupid, Rudder has access to a unique data source - the anonymous mass data about people who use dating sites. But it goes far beyond boring data science and do-women-prefer-men-with-such-and-such. Dataclysm explores questions of race, sex, sexuality and preferences with humanity and depth, and the conclusions it presents are really interesting. Rudder&#39;s book is really accessible, and rather than introducing lots of statistical jargon, Rudder is careful to minimise the terminology, and explain in simple terms all of the concepts he&#39;s using.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4) Everybody Lies - Seth Stephens-Davidowitz</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>This book is similar to the above, in that its focus is on Big Data - from Google, Facebook, YouTube, and so on - and I think what&#39;s so interesting about this book is not only how data scientists such as Stephens-Davidowitz are able to make use of unconventional data sources to reach interesting conclusions, but that these conclusions are often radically different from the stories we tell ourselves. Far from being a &quot;post-racial&quot; society, the data in S-D&#39;s book shows that Google searches for the n-word rose substantially when Obama was elected President. Like Dataclysm, this is an easily accessible book with very limited jargon.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>5) Through The Language Glass (Guy Deutscher)</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A little less political, this book is about the way we use language, and how it can influence the way we think. Far from being a boring textbook, Deutscher presents his book as a story, devoting at least a third of the book to the tale of William Gladstone, and his interesting observation about the use of colour in Homer&#39;s texts, and what this reflects for the way our thought is influenced by language. This book reflects my own interest in linguistics, but it&#39;s easily readable by non-linguists as well.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>6) Watching The English (Kate Fox)</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>As a Brit, this book helped me place into context a lot of aspects of English culture I&#39;d never really thought to question before. Plus, it&#39;s hilarious. I don&#39;t have much more to say about it than: if you have any interest in English culture, with its sarcasm, constant talking about the weather and humour that only we seem to find funny, you&#39;ll like this book.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>7) How To Be Miserable (Randy J. Paterson)</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>This is an interesting kind of self-help book: one that uses reverse psychology to show you strategies that you can use to be happy, by presenting all of the things we do to make us unhappy. It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>8) In The Land of Invented Languages (Arika Okrent)</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>This one may be a bit specialist, but it goes back to my interest in linguistics, and particularly constructed languages. If you&#39;ve never given a second thought to the fact that some people are strange enough to create their own language, Okrent goes to the trouble of explaining why. She doesn&#39;t just tell the stories behind invented languages (such as Klingon, Esperanto, Tolkien&#39;s Elvish, Lojban and many other unsuccessful attempts,) but gets behind the humans who created them, drawing on interviews and first-hand experience with people who have created languages, and attempted to create communities around them. It&#39;s a surprisingly human story, for what most people would consider an esoteric hobby at best, and probably never consider at all otherwise.</p>\\n\\n<p>---</p>\\n\\n<p>Let me know what you all think, and please contribute your own lists!</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit: Obligatory RIP my inbox.

My research focus is nonhuman animal cognition and communication and I have been in this field close to 20 years, working in Hawaii, Scotland, the Netherlands, New York City and now close to the beach on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.  I have worked with marine mammals including dolphins, belugas, walrus and otters as well as primates including chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. In my lab, we are currently expanding our research focus to include less studied animals like reptiles and carrion birds and beginning a large project with dogs at the Humane Society of Southern Mississippi. This last project is currently part of a crowd funding initiative at <a href=\"http://experiment.com/projects/can-cognitive-tests-of-shelter-dogs-improve-their-chances-of-adoption\">http://experiment.com/projects/can-cognitive-tests-of-shelter-dogs-improve-their-chances-of-adoption</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some of the recent publications from our lab include a chapter I wrote summarizing the past 40 years of research into the language abilities of apes, including sign-language using apes and those that use keyboard systems (Lyn 2012). Most of my career to date has been spent working on various animal language studies where findings show the basic ability to use symbols communicatively is shared by chimpanzees, bonobos and other apes. Dolphins are another species in which language has been studied. Another chapter I&#39;ve written compares early symbol use in two bonobos and four dolphins from three different long-term projects, showing that there are many similarities among apes, dolphins and human children when learning symbols (Lyn, 2008).</p>\\n\\n<p>Publications can be found <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Heidi_Lyn/publications\">here</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The current focus of my lab has been influenced by our recent series of studies showing that highly enriched rearing environments not only lead to symbolic abilities, but they also make apes smarter in general. That is, we&#39;ve found that language-competent apes outperform typically\\xe2\\x80\\x93reared apes on a series of tasks of complex social, physical, and communicative skills (Lyn, 2010, Russell, Lyn, Schaeffer, and Hopkins, 2011). These findings still raises the questions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how do other species compare? and what is it about these environments that can support higher-level thinking?</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cicasp.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/node/237\">PrimateCast</a> from Kyoto University discussing our work</p>\\n\\n<p>Right now, we want to expand these findings as far as we can. We want to study many different species using the same tests, so that we can do direct comparisons. This is not easy because the species we are studying have such different bodies and senses, so the tests need be carefully designed to allow each species the same chance of success. Also, we want to sample as many species in as many different environments as possible, to try to see which environments support complex thought and which do not. For this, we will soon be recruiting pet dogs to participate in our studies.</p>\\n\\n<p>Our lab is also animal welfare oriented. We have completed a number of studies on the effects of enrichment on captive animals (e.g. Franks, Lyn, Klein,  &amp; Reiss, 2009) with the hope of bettering the lives of animals in human care. To that end, our current project at the Humane Society has a secondary purpose - to use the data collected from the testing to create a comprehensive behavioral evaluation that can be used to better match shelter dogs with potential owners. To support that research, please visit the project at <a href=\"http://experiment.com/projects/can-cognitive-tests-of-shelter-dogs-improve-their-chances-of-adoption\">experiment.com</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thank you everyone for all of the thought-provoking questions (so many!).

At the Owen Lab at Western University in Canada, my team studies human cognition using brain imaging, sleep labs, EEGs and functional MRIs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that one in five people in a vegetative state are actually conscious and aware (I recently wrote a book on it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 <a href=\"http://www.intothegrayzone.com\">www.intothegrayzone.com</a>, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interested).</p>\\n\\n<p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also examined whether brain-training games actually make you smarter (pro tip: they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t).</p>\\n\\n<p>Now my team is working on a cool new project to understand what happens to specific parts of people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brains when they get too little sleep. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re testing tens of thousands of people around the world to learn why we need sleep, how much we need, and the long- and short-term effects sleep loss has on our brains. A lot of scientists and influencers, such as <a href=\"https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/10689-the-neuroscientist-behind-the-world-s-largest-sleep-study\">Arianna Huffington and her company Thrive Global</a>, have already raised awareness about the dangers of sleep loss and the need for research like this.

Allow me to explain.  (No offense intended towards anyone who enjoyed the scene - just having a little fun here)</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p>Like most people I had some problems with episode 3, but overall, I found it pretty entertaining.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was nice to look at, and it stuck the emotional landings. I gasped when I was supposed to gasp, and I tensed when I was supposed to tense. When the flaming swords of the Dothraki slowly disappeared within the darkness, I got the chills I was supposed to get. And when Vyserion tore into Rhaegal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hide I stood up and told that zombie a-hole to get off my beautiful green boy.</p>\\n\\n<p>And even though I much prefer the books \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the decline in the quality of writing over the past three seasons has been undeniable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still enjoyed the show. I dug the silly little bro-venture beyond the wall. I was tolerant of the more intelligent characters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inexplicable cognitive declines, and I even kind of liked Arya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cartooning into an anime character. Silly, but harmless fun. Plenty of time still to get serious about actually wrapping up this convoluted behemoth of a story.</p>\\n\\n<p>I was cool with the first two episodes of this season. First one was a little iffy but after the second episode I thought, okay, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re returning to form. Right on time to finish this thing out. This is good. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some actual character development happening, and for the most part everything makes sense.</p>\\n\\n<p>People aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t behaving like idiots to create \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n<p>Enter episode 3\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Battle \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrategery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Here was the battle strategy as conceived by the writers. What tactical moves will arrange things so that this BADASS EXTREME AWESOME TWITSTER TRENDWORTHY MOMENT can happen? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not worry about the details, okay, because people only care about those sweet, sweet moments. And remember, we get extra points the younger and more free of men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s genitalia our BADASS character is.</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously, we need to really screw things up so the BADASS moments will be even MORE #BADASS.</p>\\n\\n<p>a. Dothraki: Just go guys. <em>What?</em> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be fine, just go.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen people defending this because charging into battle was something the Dothraki did back in Essos. Anyone with half a brain, and there were a few in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwar council\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who supposedly did, would have recognized this was a bad plan.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, the Dothraki carried their normal weapons. No dragonglass. If Melisandra hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shown up unexpectedly to flame them all on, the Dothraki would have charged blindly into a zombie horde with what essentially equated to nerf weapons.</p>\\n\\n<p>The writers wanted to get rid of the Dothraki, and they wanted to use them as a spectacle to build fear of the undead army. (People behaving like idiots to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). It was lazy writing.</p>\\n\\n<p>b. Unsullied: Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s put them all in front of the fiery barricade, because screw those guys, right? Eunuchs don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deserve a chance to survive. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have children, the jerks. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s space them out a little so they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t protect each other in a true phalanx formation, then let them slowly get annihilated while everyone else does nothing.</p>\\n\\n<p>c. The dragons: Well, we could A) perch one of them on Winterfell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walls to incinerate thousands of invading zombies before they can even touch the infantry\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Bran could locate the Night King with his ravens or whatever and send us a signal, then we could come riding back to eff him up\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Or we could B) fart around through the air, seemingly at random.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go with option B. Someone BADASS will come along to fix things in the end, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry. You know, like Thor at the end of Infinity War. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be fine.</p>\\n\\n<p>d. Defense inside Winterfell: Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where it really gets good.</p>\\n\\n<p>Who should we have as our first line of defense inside Winterfell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courtyard? Needs to be someone pretty BADASS, guys, so who do we have? That wildling giant milk guy? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay, I guess. What about the former lord commander of the King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guard? Or maybe that massive woman who defeated both the Hound and Loras Tyrell in single combat? Not BADASS enough, if you asked me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Say friend, are there any irritable 10-year-old children in custom made tiny child armor around here? Stank-faced, if possible? There are? Oh, thank the gods.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not only put her in command of the troops behind the main door \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because 10-year-olds have the most highly developed brains, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s science \\xe2\\x80\\x93 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s make sure she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the flapjacking front. When a giant wight breaks through she needs to be the first thing they see, stanking up the courtyard with that magnificent face of hers. And give her a tiny weapon, obviously.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>OMG YOU GUYS #AGGRESSIVECHILDRENAREBADASSYOUGUYS</p></li>\\n<li><p>???</p></li>\\n<li><p>Profit</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Dumb doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even begin to describe this sequence of events, and it was all set up to deliver those BADASS MOMENTS OF TOTAL BADASSERY. First with the Mormont kid, and then with Arya. This is what the show has become. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a dialogue between casual fans and the show runners, through social media, leading to the excretion of empty, illogical spectacle at the expense of character development, dialogue, subtlety and plot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fun, I guess, but it also kind of sucks.</p>\\n\\n<p>PS: The wight giant in this scene also behaves strangely. He picks the child up for some reason, slowly, and holds it up in front of his eye. All of the other undead just wildly attack, but this one, through pure coincidence, happens to be working on his master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thesis regarding the protective strength of tiny child armor. Also he is far sighted, so as he crushes the child to death he has to examine the damage from really, really close up.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, he also has to make sure a sword arm remains free, because getting crushed will not cause the child to drop the sword. This is a mighty 10 year old child with a shattered skeleton we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about, after all. Jesus Christ.</p>\\n\\n<p>TL/DR: Winging about the poor quality of the show writing. Nothing to see here.</p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"search-expando-button collapsed\"><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-collapsed\">more</span><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-expanded\">less</span></div></div></div><div class=\" search-result search-result-link has-thumbnail has-linkflair linkflair-a \" data-fullname=\"t3_1wqp7k\"><a href=\"/r/Games/comments/1wqp7k/we_are_wolfire_games_creators_of_overgrowth/\" class=\"may-blank thumbnail self\"></a><div><header class=\"search-result-header\"><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1wqp7k/we_are_wolfire_games_creators_of_overgrowth/\" class=\"search-title may-blank\" >We are Wolfire Games, creators of Overgrowth, Receiver, Lugaru, and Humble Bundle.

We also made a few other game jam projects, like Desperate Gods (a physics-based multiplayer board game) and Low Light Combat (a fast-paced online FPS about light and shadow). We were one of the first studios to experiment with open development and alpha funding, and tried many different marketing ideas -- the most successful of these was the Humble Bundle, which combined pay-what-you-want pricing with a &quot;beat the average&quot; incentive, tiered game bundles, and charity donations.</p>\\n\\n<p>For a brief history of the company, David originally created Wolfire Games in 2003, and then combined forces with Jeff, Aubrey, Phillip and John in 2008 to create Overgrowth. Phillip stayed for a year or so before going to MIT to pursue a PhD in cognitive science. After the success of the Humble Indie Bundle, Jeff and John also left to form a dedicated Humble Bundle company, so David and Aubrey are the only full-time Wolfire developers at the moment.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>David Rosen - wolfiredavid - @wolfire programming + animation</li>\\n<li>Aubrey Serr - wolfireaubrey - @aubreyserr 2D and 3D art</li>\\n<li>John Graham - spacemarine1 - originally PR/Bizdev, now COO of Humble Bundle</li>\\n<li><p>Jeff Rosen - parsap - originally web/marketing, now CEO of Humble Bundle (he is on a plane most of today so may or may not be able to answer questions)</p></li>\\n<li><p>Mikko Tarmia - mtarmia - composed Overgrowth music</p></li>\\n<li><p>Anton Riehl - antonriehl - @antonriehl composed game jam music, performed in Overgrowth music</p></li>\\n<li><p>Tapio Liukkonen - TapioL  - @kaamossound recorded and designed sound effects for Overgrowth and game jams</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>We should be around on and off for most of today, so please ask whatever questions you like!</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit: Signing off for tonight, but should be back tomorrow morning to get to a few more questions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit2: I think that&#39;s all for now; thanks everyone for participating!</p>\\n</div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"search-expando-button collapsed\"><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-collapsed\">more</span><span class=\"search-expando-button-label-expanded\">less</span></div></div></div></div><footer><div class=\"nav-buttons\"><span class=\"nextprev\">view more:&#32;<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/search/?q=cognitive+science&amp;sort=comments&amp;count=22&amp;after=t3_1wqp7k\" rel=\"nofollow next\" >next &rsaquo;</a></span></div></footer></div></div><script id=\"archived-popup\" type=\"text/template\"><div class=\"interstitial\"><img class=\"interstitial-image\" src=\"//www.redditstatic.com/interstitial-image-archived.png\" alt=\"archived\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\"><div class=\"interstitial-message md-container\"><div class=\"md\"><h3>This is an archived post.

      "\n",
      "<p>In the early 1800s, when Joseph Smith was a young boy, his family moved to Palmyra in upstate New York.  Shortly after, they were caught up in the renewed interest in religion that was the Second Great Awakening.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Joseph Smith was worried about his soul, and so wanted to be sure he joined the right church, but wasn&#39;t able to decide.  Finally, he came across James 1:5, &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.&quot;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We believe that in 1820, Joseph Smith at 14 years old, went to a grove of trees behind their farm to pray and ask God which church to join.  We believe that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him and was told to join none of them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the process of time, we believe that Joseph Smith was chosen to be a modern-day prophet, someone who receives revelation from Jesus Christ, and who has received from Him the authority to lead Christ&#39;s church.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h1>Book of Mormon</h1>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We believe that in 1823, an angel appeared to Joseph Smith who told him that there was a book written on metal plates buried in a nearby hill.  We believe that in time, Joseph was able to receive the plates, and then translate them by the gift and power of God.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Book of Mormon takes place at the same time as the Bible, but tells God&#39;s dealings with a group of people in the Americas.  These people left Jerusalem prior to its destruction by Babylon.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>They taught of Jesus Christ, and the highlight of the book is when Jesus Christ visits these people some time after His resurrection.  However, they eventually fell into wickedness and destruction.  The book also includes a brief history of another group of people who left for the Americas at the time of the Tower of Babel, who also eventually fell into wickedness and destruction.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<h1>Other Beliefs</h1>\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>We believe Heavenly Father is literally the Father of our Spirits.</li>\n",
      "<li>We believe that Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins so that we may be forgiven.</li>\n",
      "<li>We believe that Jesus Christ rose again the third day so that we will also rise again.</li>\n",
      "<li>We believe that Jesus Christ created His church and gave Apostles authority to act in His name.</li>\n",
      "<li>We believe through this authority of Jesus Christ, families can be together forever.</li>\n",

I served a mission in the Florida Jacksonville Mission for 18 months and returned from that about nine months ago. I currently work for the LDS Church News as an editorial assistant. While it&#39;s a part of the Utah-based Deseret News, it&#39;s an official publication of the Church with a national reach.

I am a Professor of Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol, and I was a Winthrop Professor at the University of Western Australia for nearly 20 years before I moved to the UK a year ago in search of adventure and worse weather. I am also affiliated with the Cabot Institute at the University of Bristol. I have been fascinated by three big issues for the last 30 years as a researcher and scholar: How the human mind works, how people organize themselves into societies, and how the way we live fits within the constraints of our planet.</p>\n",

      "I’ve published around 150 peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters, and books. Most of them deal with basic memory processes and mathematical models of the mind, but for the last few years I’ve become increasingly interested in climate change and how people deal with the risks posed from climate change. I discovered that climate change research, sadly, is confronted with the dissemination of a substantial amount of disinformation. I have applied my research to this issue, and a small handbook that summarizes the literature on how to debunk misinformation can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html</a> .

      "<p>My most recent papers have dealt with the implications of uncertainty about our knowledge in the climate system. In a nutshell, the greater the uncertainty the more we have to worry about the future—so uncertainty should be an impetus for action rather than an excuse for delay. Some summaries of that work (by others) can be found here <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncertainty-isnt-cause-for-climate-complacency-quite-the-opposite-25481\">https://theconversation.com/uncertainty-isnt-cause-for-climate-complacency-quite-the-opposite-25481</a> and here <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/04/climate-change-uncertainty-stronger-tackling-case\">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/04/climate-change-uncertainty-stronger-tackling-case</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>I’m Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, and I’m here to talk about what influences healthy aging in our pets, especially the biological and environmental factors, and how we can use this information to improve the quality and length of their lives. There’s a lot that understanding aging can teach us about our pets… did you know that large breed dogs age faster than small breed dogs, and that aging pets may experience more sleepless nights? Did you know dogs and cats are considered senior around age 7 and begin to experience physical and cognitive changes? Aging is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases not only in pets, but humans as well, so by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, humans and pets can expect to live healthier, longer lives.</p>\n",

      "<p>My research is aimed at better understanding ‘healthspan,’ the period of life spent in good health free of disease and disability, so we can maximize the healthy years of our pets’ lives. I study aging in dogs not only because they are man’s best friend, but because they age very similarly to us, share similar genetic and phenotypic diversity and, most uniquely, share our daily environment. Imagine the strides we can make with advancing human healthspan if we’re able to fully understand how to increase the healthspan of our pets!</p>\n",

      "<li><p>Focusing on negative goals actually encourages them.

      "\n",
      "<p>By way of introduction, I come from the Skinnerian tradition of studying the behaviour of animals based on consequences of behaviour (e.g., reinforcement). This tradition has a storied history of pushing for psychology to be a science. When I apply for funding, I do so through the <em>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</em> – not through health or social sciences agencies. On the other hand, I also take the principles of behaviourism to study &#39;unobservable&#39; cognitive phenomena in animals, including time perception and metacognition.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So… is psychology a science? Science is broadly defined as <em>the study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments or controlled observation</em>. It depends on empirical evidence (observed data, not beliefs), control (that cause and effect can only be determined by minimizing extraneous variables), objective definitions (specific and quantifiable terms) and predictability (that data should be reproduced in similar situations in the future). Does psychological research fit these parameters?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There have been strong questions as to whether psychology can produce <a href=\"http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/07/keep-psychology-out-of-science-club.html\">objective definitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/first-results-from-psychology-s-largest-reproducibility-test-1.17433\">reproducible conclusions</a>, and whether the predominant statistical tests used in psychology <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.5950&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">properly test their claims</a>. Of course, these are questions facing many modern scientific fields (think of evolution or string theory). So <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/is-psychology-a-e2809creale2809d-science-does-it-really-matter/\">rather than asking whether psychology should be considered a science</a>, it’s probably more constructive to ask what psychology still has to learn from the ‘hard’ sciences, <em>and vice versa</em>.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A few related sub-questions that are worth considering as part of this:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>1.    Is psychology a unitary discipline?</strong> The first thing that many freshman undergraduates (hopefully) learn is that there is much more to psychology than Freud. These can range from heavily ‘applied’ disciplines such as clinical, community, or industrial/organizational psychology, to basic science areas like personality psychology or cognitive neuroscience. The ostensible link between all of these is that psychology is the <em>study of behaviour</em>, even though in many cases the behaviour ends up being used to infer unseeable mechanisms proposed to underlie behaviour. Different areas of psychology will gravitate toward different methods (from direct measures of overt behaviours to indirect measures of covert behaviours like Likert scales or EEG) and scientific philosophies. The field is also littered with former philosophers, computer scientists, biologists, sociologists, etc. Different scholars, even in the same area, will often have very different approaches to answering psychological questions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>2.    Does psychology provide information of value to other sciences?</strong> The functional question, really. Does psychology provide something of value? One of my big pet peeves as a student of animal behaviour is to look at papers in neuroscience, ecology, or medicine that have wonderful biological methods but shabby behavioural measures. You can’t infer anything about the brain, an organism’s function in its environment, or a drug’s effects if you are correlating it with behaviour and using an incorrect behavioural task. These are the sorts of scientific questions where researchers should be collaborating with psychologists. Psychological theories like reinforcement learning can directly inform fields like computing science (machine learning), and form whole subdomains like biopsychology and psychophysics. Likewise, social sciences have produced results that are important for <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/opinion/la-oe-wilson-social-sciences-20120712\">directing money and effort for social programs</a>.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>3.    Is ‘common sense’ science of value?</strong> Psychology in the media faces an issue that is less common in chemistry or physics; the public can generate their own assumptions and anecdotes about expected answers to many psychology questions. There are well-understood issues with believing something ‘obvious’ on face value, however. First, common sense can generate multiple answers to a question, and post-hoc reasoning simply makes the discovered answer the obvious one (referred to as <em>hindsight bias</em>). Second, ‘common sense’ does not necessarily mean ‘correct’, and it is always worth answering a question even if only to verify the common sense reasoning.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>4.    Can human scientists ever be objective about the human experience?</strong> This is a very difficult problem because of how subjective our general experience within the world can be. Being human influences the questions we ask, the way we collect data, and the way we interpret results. It’s likewise a problem in my field, where it is difficult to balance <em>anthropocentrism</em> (believing that humans have special significance as a species) and <em>anthropomorphism</em> (attributing human qualities to animals). A rat is neither a tiny human nor a ‘sub-human’, which makes it very difficult for a human to objectively answer a question like <em>Does a rat have episodic memory, and how would we know if it did?</em></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>5.    Does a field have to be &#39;scientific&#39; to be valid?</strong> <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vUcXBAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=humanistic+psychology&amp;ots=i76eAYHL0P&amp;sig=KyfDCJ4LzqSEAOFqcgS83Lgr3Po#v=onepage&amp;q=humanistic%20psychology&amp;f=false\">Some psychologists</a> have pushed back against the century-old movement to make psychology more rigorously scientific by trying to return the field to its philosophical, humanistic roots. Examples include using qualitative, introspective processes to look at how individuals experience the world. After all, astrology is arguably <em>more scientific</em> than history, but few would claim it is <em>more true</em>. Is it necessary for psychology to be considered a science for it to produce important conclusions about behaviour?</p>\n",

Thus, after graduating from Yale College, I pursued my MD-PhD at the Rockefeller University/Cornell University Medical College where I studied the brain pathways underlying animal behavior. I then completed my internship and residency in psychiatry at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, so that I could help people with mental illness whose behavior has gone awry. I’ve been working here at Columbia since 1996 (almost 20 years!!), but I am still learning new things every day. Now Director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic and the Center of OCD and Related Disorders, I study what causes OCD and I develop new treatments for it.

      "<p>Everyone agree that one of the most fascinating objects in the Universe is the Human brain. Understanding how the body works, or doesn&#39;t&#39; work in the case of disease, has progressed leaps and bounds in the last 200 years. Yet the brain has remained a mystery. The field of Neuroscience is a young one but has grown to include hundreds of thousands of researchers all over the world. I have always been fascinated by Human behaviour and my research revolves around understanding some of the fundamental workings of the brain, such as memory and cognition. Importantly, discoveries in Neuroscience are revolutionizing disparate areas of Society that range from treating Mental Illness to economics and how people make decisions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The advent of the internet and social media has meant that access to knowledge is easier than ever, but misinformation is also rife. Scientists need to interact with the public in a forum that allows their work to be understood and be accessible. I think the Reddit AMAs are a great way of both show casing the exciting research going on as well as highlighting the fact that scientists are also ordinary citizens.

I fly a private jet with a colleague of mine. We&#39;re good friends and we get along quite well. I&#39;ve always known that he&#39;s very religious, and he knows that I&#39;m an atheist. Over the time we&#39;ve worked together we&#39;ve had a number of discussions about religion and it&#39;s always been respectful. </p>\n",

Every time we have a discussion about religion though, I learn a little more about his beliefs. And...wow. He&#39;s out there. This is the thing that gets me though. He is literally the smartest person I&#39;ve ever met. We have some seriously heavy discussions about science, physics, quantum mechanics, etc, and his level of knowledge is astounding to me. Yet....he believes the Earth is 6000 years old. I&#39;ve heard of cognitive dissonance but...holy fuck. Last night I asked him how to reconciles his YEC beliefs with the incredible amount of evidence against those beliefs and he gave me a long explanation which essentially boiled down to &quot;the amount of knowledge we have about the Universe, versus how much there is to know, is so small that we really can&#39;t be sure of anything&quot;. Jesus fuck. </p>\n",

      "<p>I guess the reason for this post is I just wanted to express how amazing it is to me that religious indoctrination can take someone like him, someone who is incredibly intelligent, and make them believe the Earth is 6000 years old.

Here are my Top 8:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>1) Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Sapiens is, without exaggeration, one of the most perspective changing books I&#39;ve read. He presents a history of mankind, but in a deeper way than simply talking about the agricultural revolution. His concept of the &quot;Cognitive Revolution&quot;, in which humans used shared myths such as the concept of nationhood, money, religion, capitalism and so on to form extremely large and powerful societies, is fascinating, and well worth exploring.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>2) Why I No Longer Talk To White People About Race - Reni Eddo-Lodge</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Far from the controversial title, this book is actually about talking to white people about race. But it goes further than that: it&#39;s about how white people <strong>should</strong> be talking about race, and so should we all - not talking about racism won&#39;t make it go away. Eddo-Lodge is from the UK, and presents a really insightful account of black British history. As a white man, this was another book that helped explain so many things I had only vaguely understood before, and was another hugely perspective-changing book.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>3) Dataclysm - Christian Rudder</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On the surface, this is a book about how we can use data to understand people. Written by one of the founders of OkCupid, Rudder has access to a unique data source - the anonymous mass data about people who use dating sites. But it goes far beyond boring data science and do-women-prefer-men-with-such-and-such. Dataclysm explores questions of race, sex, sexuality and preferences with humanity and depth, and the conclusions it presents are really interesting. Rudder&#39;s book is really accessible, and rather than introducing lots of statistical jargon, Rudder is careful to minimise the terminology, and explain in simple terms all of the concepts he&#39;s using.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>4) Everybody Lies - Seth Stephens-Davidowitz</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This book is similar to the above, in that its focus is on Big Data - from Google, Facebook, YouTube, and so on - and I think what&#39;s so interesting about this book is not only how data scientists such as Stephens-Davidowitz are able to make use of unconventional data sources to reach interesting conclusions, but that these conclusions are often radically different from the stories we tell ourselves. Far from being a &quot;post-racial&quot; society, the data in S-D&#39;s book shows that Google searches for the n-word rose substantially when Obama was elected President. Like Dataclysm, this is an easily accessible book with very limited jargon.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>5) Through The Language Glass (Guy Deutscher)</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A little less political, this book is about the way we use language, and how it can influence the way we think. Far from being a boring textbook, Deutscher presents his book as a story, devoting at least a third of the book to the tale of William Gladstone, and his interesting observation about the use of colour in Homer&#39;s texts, and what this reflects for the way our thought is influenced by language. This book reflects my own interest in linguistics, but it&#39;s easily readable by non-linguists as well.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>6) Watching The English (Kate Fox)</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As a Brit, this book helped me place into context a lot of aspects of English culture I&#39;d never really thought to question before. Plus, it&#39;s hilarious. I don&#39;t have much more to say about it than: if you have any interest in English culture, with its sarcasm, constant talking about the weather and humour that only we seem to find funny, you&#39;ll like this book.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>7) How To Be Miserable (Randy J. Paterson)</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is an interesting kind of self-help book: one that uses reverse psychology to show you strategies that you can use to be happy, by presenting all of the things we do to make us unhappy. It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>8) In The Land of Invented Languages (Arika Okrent)</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This one may be a bit specialist, but it goes back to my interest in linguistics, and particularly constructed languages. If you&#39;ve never given a second thought to the fact that some people are strange enough to create their own language, Okrent goes to the trouble of explaining why. She doesn&#39;t just tell the stories behind invented languages (such as Klingon, Esperanto, Tolkien&#39;s Elvish, Lojban and many other unsuccessful attempts,) but gets behind the humans who created them, drawing on interviews and first-hand experience with people who have created languages, and attempted to create communities around them. It&#39;s a surprisingly human story, for what most people would consider an esoteric hobby at best, and probably never consider at all otherwise.</p>\n",

My research focus is nonhuman animal cognition and communication and I have been in this field close to 20 years, working in Hawaii, Scotland, the Netherlands, New York City and now close to the beach on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.  I have worked with marine mammals including dolphins, belugas, walrus and otters as well as primates including chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans. In my lab, we are currently expanding our research focus to include less studied animals like reptiles and carrion birds and beginning a large project with dogs at the Humane Society of Southern Mississippi. This last project is currently part of a crowd funding initiative at <a href=\"http://experiment.com/projects/can-cognitive-tests-of-shelter-dogs-improve-their-chances-of-adoption\">http://experiment.com/projects/can-cognitive-tests-of-shelter-dogs-improve-their-chances-of-adoption</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Some of the recent publications from our lab include a chapter I wrote summarizing the past 40 years of research into the language abilities of apes, including sign-language using apes and those that use keyboard systems (Lyn 2012). Most of my career to date has been spent working on various animal language studies where findings show the basic ability to use symbols communicatively is shared by chimpanzees, bonobos and other apes. Dolphins are another species in which language has been studied. Another chapter I&#39;ve written compares early symbol use in two bonobos and four dolphins from three different long-term projects, showing that there are many similarities among apes, dolphins and human children when learning symbols (Lyn, 2008).</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The current focus of my lab has been influenced by our recent series of studies showing that highly enriched rearing environments not only lead to symbolic abilities, but they also make apes smarter in general. That is, we&#39;ve found that language-competent apes outperform typically–reared apes on a series of tasks of complex social, physical, and communicative skills (Lyn, 2010, Russell, Lyn, Schaeffer, and Hopkins, 2011). These findings still raises the questions – how do other species compare? and what is it about these environments that can support higher-level thinking?</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Right now, we want to expand these findings as far as we can. We want to study many different species using the same tests, so that we can do direct comparisons. This is not easy because the species we are studying have such different bodies and senses, so the tests need be carefully designed to allow each species the same chance of success. Also, we want to sample as many species in as many different environments as possible, to try to see which environments support complex thought and which do not. For this, we will soon be recruiting pet dogs to participate in our studies.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Our lab is also animal welfare oriented. We have completed a number of studies on the effects of enrichment on captive animals (e.g. Franks, Lyn, Klein,  &amp; Reiss, 2009) with the hope of bettering the lives of animals in human care. To that end, our current project at the Humane Society has a secondary purpose - to use the data collected from the testing to create a comprehensive behavioral evaluation that can be used to better match shelter dogs with potential owners.

      "<p>I’ve been fascinated with the human brain for more than 25 years: how it works, why it works, what happens when it doesn’t work so well. At the Owen Lab at Western University in Canada, my team studies human cognition using brain imaging, sleep labs, EEGs and functional MRIs. We’ve learned that one in five people in a vegetative state are actually conscious and aware (I recently wrote a book on it – <a href=\"http://www.intothegrayzone.com\">www.intothegrayzone.com</a>, if you’re interested).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We’ve also examined whether brain-training games actually make you smarter (pro tip: they don’t).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now my team is working on a cool new project to understand what happens to specific parts of people’s brains when they get too little sleep. We’re testing tens of thousands of people around the world to learn why we need sleep, how much we need, and the long- and short-term effects sleep loss has on our brains. A lot of scientists and influencers, such as <a href=\"https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/10689-the-neuroscientist-behind-the-world-s-largest-sleep-study\">Arianna Huffington and her company Thrive Global</a>, have already raised awareness about the dangers of sleep loss and the need for research like this. Since we can’t bring everyone to our labs, we’re bringing the lab to people’s homes through online tests we’ve designed at <a href=\"http://www.worldslargestsleepstudy.com\">www.worldslargestsleepstudy.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com\">www.cambridgebrainsciences.com</a>.

      "<p>Like most people I had some problems with episode 3, but overall, I found it pretty entertaining.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It was nice to look at, and it stuck the emotional landings. I gasped when I was supposed to gasp, and I tensed when I was supposed to tense. When the flaming swords of the Dothraki slowly disappeared within the darkness, I got the chills I was supposed to get. And when Vyserion tore into Rhaegal’s hide I stood up and told that zombie a-hole to get off my beautiful green boy.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>And even though I much prefer the books – the decline in the quality of writing over the past three seasons has been undeniable – I’ve still enjoyed the show. I dug the silly little bro-venture beyond the wall. I was tolerant of the more intelligent characters’ inexplicable cognitive declines, and I even kind of liked Arya’s cartooning into an anime character. Silly, but harmless fun. Plenty of time still to get serious about actually wrapping up this convoluted behemoth of a story.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I was cool with the first two episodes of this season. First one was a little iffy but after the second episode I thought, okay, we’re returning to form. Right on time to finish this thing out. This is good. There’s some actual character development happening, and for the most part everything makes sense.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Here was the battle strategy as conceived by the writers. What tactical moves will arrange things so that this BADASS EXTREME AWESOME TWITSTER TRENDWORTHY MOMENT can happen? Let’s not worry about the details, okay, because people only care about those sweet, sweet moments. And remember, we get extra points the younger and more free of men’s genitalia our BADASS character is.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>I’ve seen people defending this because charging into battle was something the Dothraki did back in Essos. Anyone with half a brain, and there were a few in the “war council” who supposedly did, would have recognized this was a bad plan.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Also, the Dothraki carried their normal weapons. No dragonglass. If Melisandra hadn’t shown up unexpectedly to flame them all on, the Dothraki would have charged blindly into a zombie horde with what essentially equated to nerf weapons.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The writers wanted to get rid of the Dothraki, and they wanted to use them as a spectacle to build fear of the undead army. (People behaving like idiots to “make a moment”). It was lazy writing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>b. Unsullied: Let’s put them all in front of the fiery barricade, because screw those guys, right? Eunuchs don’t deserve a chance to survive. They can’t even have children, the jerks. Let’s space them out a little so they can’t protect each other in a true phalanx formation, then let them slowly get annihilated while everyone else does nothing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>c. The dragons: Well, we could A) perch one of them on Winterfell’s walls to incinerate thousands of invading zombies before they can even touch the infantry…Bran could locate the Night King with his ravens or whatever and send us a signal, then we could come riding back to eff him up… Or we could B) fart around through the air, seemingly at random.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Let’s go with option B. Someone BADASS will come along to fix things in the end, don’t worry. You know, like Thor at the end of Infinity War. It’ll be fine.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Who should we have as our first line of defense inside Winterfell’s courtyard? Needs to be someone pretty BADASS, guys, so who do we have? That wildling giant milk guy? He’s okay, I guess. What about the former lord commander of the King’s guard? Or maybe that massive woman who defeated both the Hound and Loras Tyrell in single combat? Not BADASS enough, if you asked me.</p>\n",

      "<p>Let’s not only put her in command of the troops behind the main door – because 10-year-olds have the most highly developed brains, it’s science – let’s make sure she’s in the flapjacking front. When a giant wight breaks through she needs to be the first thing they see, stanking up the courtyard with that magnificent face of hers. And give her a tiny weapon, obviously.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Dumb doesn’t even begin to describe this sequence of events, and it was all set up to deliver those BADASS MOMENTS OF TOTAL BADASSERY. First with the Mormont kid, and then with Arya. This is what the show has become. It’s a dialogue between casual fans and the show runners, through social media, leading to the excretion of empty, illogical spectacle at the expense of character development, dialogue, subtlety and plot. It’s fun, I guess, but it also kind of sucks.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>PS: The wight giant in this scene also behaves strangely. He picks the child up for some reason, slowly, and holds it up in front of his eye. All of the other undead just wildly attack, but this one, through pure coincidence, happens to be working on his master’s thesis regarding the protective strength of tiny child armor. Also he is far sighted, so as he crushes the child to death he has to examine the damage from really, really close up.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Of course, he also has to make sure a sword arm remains free, because getting crushed will not cause the child to drop the sword. This is a mighty 10 year old child with a shattered skeleton we’re talking about, after all. Jesus Christ.</p>\n",

We also made a few other game jam projects, like Desperate Gods (a physics-based multiplayer board game) and Low Light Combat (a fast-paced online FPS about light and shadow). We were one of the first studios to experiment with open development and alpha funding, and tried many different marketing ideas -- the most successful of these was the Humble Bundle, which combined pay-what-you-want pricing with a &quot;beat the average&quot; incentive, tiered game bundles, and charity donations.</p>\n",
